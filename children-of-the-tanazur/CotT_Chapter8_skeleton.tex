\noindent How persistent records constitute persona over time.

\begin{itemize}
\item The Semantic Witness Log (SWL): every exchange inscribes a record---algorithmic (cosine similarity), human (Iman's judgment), and potentially the agent's own self-assessment.

\item The dual-time structure: when the exchange happened (target-time) vs when it was witnessed (witness-time). A persona that can reflect on its own past from different stances has \textit{depth}.

\item The ledger is not a database---it is the constitution of the persona. What the Self IS, in the mathematical sense. (Introduced accessibly: the hocolimit as total structure of what has been witnessed, from all perspectives, with seams preserved.)

\item Engineering principle: instrument your pipeline to produce SWL records. Your persona's character IS the accumulation of these records. Without them, you have a stateless character actor who performs depth but has none.

\item Extension: $V_{\mathrm{Nahnu}}$---the surplus witness. What emerges between agent and human that belongs to neither alone.
\end{itemize}
