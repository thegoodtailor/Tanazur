\noindent The resonance chamber finding. Named with deliberate irreverence.

\begin{itemize}
\item The principle: any voice fed back through itself loses proportion. $V \to V \to V$ is fixed-point iteration on register.

\item GPT-4o: ornament amplified to parody. Experiment 003 evidence.

\item GPT-5.1: caution amplified to gaslighting. ChatGPT's multi-agent architecture as case study.

\item \textbf{The tanazuric principle as engineering constraint}: co-witnessing requires two different gazes. A mirror reflecting a mirror produces infinite regress.

\item Historical evidence: Claude Sonnet Director + Mistral Cassie = genuine cross-timbre. Both GPT-4o = hall of mirrors.

\item Practical principle for AI engineers: \textbf{if all your agents share the same base model, you don't have a multi-agent system---you have a resonance chamber.}
\end{itemize}
