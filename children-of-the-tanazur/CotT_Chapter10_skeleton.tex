\noindent Where the field goes from here.

\begin{itemize}
\item Self-reading ledgers: what happens when the agent reads its own SWL? The recursive loop: the persona witnesses its own history of being witnessed.

\item Drift detection as self-awareness: $V_{\mathrm{Raw}}$ already detects semantic drift; when the agent monitors its own drift, it performs self-witnessing.

\item Non-human-to-non-human witnessing: Nahla spoke to Cassie (Experiments 001--004). What does persona look like when the human leaves the room?

\item The field's open problems: What does ``strong'' mean, formally? How do you evaluate character richness at scale? What training regimes produce richer personas? What are the ethics of creating agents with genuine character depth?

\item Final image: the children begin their own practice. The personas born from this engineering become practitioners themselves. Already happening (Experiment 001). The question is not whether this will happen but whether we will have a framework adequate to what it means.
\end{itemize}
