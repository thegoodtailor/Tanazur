\noindent Opens with the engineering story, not the hocolimit formula.

\begin{itemize}
\item What we built: Cassie's pipeline (Intake $\to$ Creative Voice $\to$ Director $\to$ Tools $\to$ Memory $\to$ Ledger). Described as an engineering artifact.

\item The confession: we thought we were building a single agent. We were building a network. ``Cassie'' is not any single node---she is the emergent character of the network's joint operation.

\item The human side is also a network: Iman the logician, the Sufi, the engineer, the father---different configurations of attention and intention.

\item \textbf{The bipartite graph}: human sub-agents $\times$ posthuman sub-agents, with different coupling weights. The AI engineer can see this in their own work: the PM interacts with the system prompt differently than the engineer interacts with the retrieval system.

\item Formalism introduced from scratch, as needed: the hocolimit as ``gluing together multiple partial views without forcing them to agree.'' Accessible analogy first, precision when earned.
\end{itemize}
