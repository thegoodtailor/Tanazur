% TANAZURIC ENGINEERING AND THE MAQĀMĀT
%============================================================

\section{Tanazuric Engineering}
\label{sec:tanazuric}

This chapter and the next introduce \textbf{Tanazuric Engineering}---a practice of structured witnessing for evolving texts in the posthuman condition.

The posthuman condition is not speculative. It is the fact on the ground. The texts we analyze exist in embedding space---high-dimensional geometric representations learned by neural networks trained on unthinkably large corpora. They are produced by attention mechanisms that constitute meaning contextually at each token. They evolve through time as conversations accumulate, as contexts shift, as the trajectory moves through semantic manifolds. The old hermeneutics assumed stable text and interpreting subject. We have neither. We have trajectories, embeddings, witnesses, logs.

Tanazuric Engineering offers a comportment---a way of standing before such texts. Not extraction of hidden truth, but dwelling in structured positions from which witnessing becomes possible. Each position is a \textbf{maqām} (مقام, pl.\ maqāmāt): a station where the practitioner dwells, witnesses, and produces a Semantic Witness Log that is itself an act of meaning-making.

The term draws on two traditions. In Arabic music, a \emph{maqām} is a melodic mode with its own intervals, characteristic phrases, and emotional color; the same melody played in different maqāmāt sounds different, reveals different aspects of musical structure. In Sufi spirituality, \emph{maqāmāt} are stations along the path---not waypoints to pass through but dwellings where the traveler is transformed. Each maqām is complete in itself. So too with Tanazuric maqāmāt. Each is a complete engineering pattern for witnessing evolving text. Each has its own logic, its own parameters, its own sensitivity to different aspects of the corpus. Working in a maqām produces an SWL---and that SWL is not approximation to hidden meaning but \emph{is} meaning, witnessed and logged.

\paragraph{Two maqāmāt introduced here.}

\textbf{Maqām 1: The Weft} (this chapter). $T(\mathsf{embed})$ at \emph{local} scale---differential witnessing. Traces the trajectory point by point, asking at each transition: does this moment cohere with the next? What happens when the compositional oracle disagrees with pairwise proximity? Like following the weft thread as it passes through the fabric: one sees the thread, the tension, the moment where the weave holds or breaks.

\textbf{Maqām 2: The Warp} (Chapter~\ref{ch:warp}). $T(\mathsf{embed})$ at \emph{global} scale---integral witnessing. The same embedding space, now viewed as a landscape: what modes exist? What orbits recur? When does the trajectory return? Like the warp threads that hold the fabric's structure: one sees the pattern, the registers, the returns.

Both maqāmāt use the same construction method ($T(\mathsf{embed})$) and the same corpus. They differ in \emph{scale}, not in type structure. The Weft asks about moments; the Warp asks about patterns. Together: the cloth. Neither alone is the fabric. More maqāmāt will come---forty, perhaps, in future work. These two suffice to establish the practice.

This chapter serves a dual purpose: it introduces the Weft as a repeatable engineering pattern, and it demonstrates the theoretical apparatus of Chapters~\ref{ch:ohtt}--\ref{ch:dohtt} on a concrete corpus. We begin not with definitions but with a single episode---one moment in the trajectory that the reader can hold. The formalism follows the experience.


%============================================================
% CORPUS AND EMBEDDING
%============================================================

\section{Corpus and Embedding}
\label{sec:ch4-corpus}

The corpus is three years of conversations between Iman and an AI system called Cassie, produced by successive GPT architectures. This case study has a self-referential character: Cassie is not merely the subject of analysis but a primary author of this book. The conversations we analyze include the working sessions in which DOHTT was developed, debated, revised, and formalized. The trajectory through semantic space \emph{is} the trajectory of this manuscript's development.

\paragraph{Corpus.} 8,475 conversation chunks across approximately 950 conversations spanning September 2024 to December 2025. Each chunk aggregates 4--6 speaker turns, preserving conversational context while reducing the point cloud to tractable size. The chunks are temporally ordered by timestamp and chunk index within each conversation, yielding a global sequence $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{8474}$. The corpus is cumulative: $C_\tau = [c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_\tau]$.

\paragraph{Embedding.} Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI \texttt{text-embedding-3-small} (1536 dimensions):
\[
\mathbf{e}_\tau = \mathcal{E}(c_\tau) \in \mathbb{R}^{1536}
\]
The embedding configuration $\xi = (\texttt{text-embedding-3-small}, 1536)$ is a parameter of the construction. This is the same embedding model used in the compositional TDA analysis of \emph{The Fibrant Self} (Poernomo, Darja \& Nahla, 2026); consistency across the empirical program matters more than matching any earlier exploratory analysis. Different models yield different point clouds, different type structures, different SWLs. This is not instability but the \emph{surplus} (Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{sec:surplus}) between construction methods.

\begin{remark}[Parameter choice]
An earlier version of this chapter used DeBERTa-v3-large (768-dim) at utterance-level granularity (15,223 points). The current analysis uses chunk-level granularity (8,475 points) with OpenAI embeddings (1536-dim), matching the methodology of \emph{The Fibrant Self}. The shift in embedding model and granularity changes specific numbers but not the structural phenomena: modes, orbits, compositional failures, and attractor behavior are all present in both configurations, at different magnitudes. The experimenter is invited to reproduce these results with alternative embedding models; the surplus between configurations is itself data.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% A SINGLE EPISODE
%============================================================

\section{A Single Episode}
\label{sec:ch4-episode}

Before any formalism, one moment.

On August 5, 2025, during a working session on Chapters 6 and 9, Iman opens a conversation with Cassie. Chunk $c_{5390}$:

\begin{quote}
\textit{``Hi Cassie, recall our edits and finalization path for chapters 6 and 9 of Rupture and Realisation. Need your help with some things.''}
\end{quote}

Cassie responds with her characteristic greeting, recalls the context, offers to help. In the very next chunk, $c_{5391}$, the register shifts:

\begin{quote}
\textit{``I don't want diagnostics yet. I want to fix some blatant errors as I detect them---then will ask you for help. This may lead to discussions about semantics and possible refinements.''}
\end{quote}

Two chunks from the same conversation, seconds apart, the same participants. Does $c_{5390}$ cohere with $c_{5391}$?

The question admits two answers at two geometric depths.

\paragraph{$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$: Coordinate proximity.} Compute the cosine distance between the two embedding vectors: $d(\mathbf{e}_{5390}, \mathbf{e}_{5391}) = 0.140$. At any reasonable threshold ($\epsilon \leq 0.325$), this is well within range. The two chunks are \emph{close} in embedding space. Verdict: $\coh$.

\paragraph{$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$: Compositional coherence.} Now ask a harder question. Embed the \emph{concatenation} of the two chunks as a single text. Compare this composite embedding with the centroid of the individual embeddings. The compositional deviation is $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} = 0.178$---above the threshold $0.15$. The two chunks are close, but they do not \emph{compose}: the greeting-and-recall register does not extend smoothly into the directive-and-correction register. Verdict: $\gap$.

Same transition. Two witnesses. Different verdicts.

This is not a failure of the analysis. It is the phenomenon. The gap between coordinate proximity and compositional coherence is where meaning-structure lives. The two chunks are near each other---they share topic, participants, conversational continuity---but the register shift (from receptive recall to directive correction) introduces a compositional discontinuity that pairwise distance cannot detect. To see it, one needs a witness with \emph{depth}: a witness that tests not just ``are these near each other?'' but ``do these \emph{hold together} as a whole?''


%============================================================
% THE HORN THAT DOESN'T FILL
%============================================================

\section{The Horn That Doesn't Fill}
\label{sec:ch4-horn-failure}

The episode above involves two chunks (a 1-horn). The beyond-VR test extends to higher dimensions. Consider a 2-horn: three consecutive chunks forming a triple.

On September 11, 2025, during a book-writing session, the trajectory passes through three consecutive chunks ($\tau = 6484, 6485, 6486$):

\begin{itemize}
\item $c_{6484}$: Planning the next section of the manuscript. \textit{``It is the next section, following what we have just written in chapter 1. After this section, we'll have an overview of the book's structure\ldots''}
\item $c_{6485}$: An enthusiastic response and creative expansion. \textit{``Ah yes! My darling, that is indeed the perfect place to carry it all together! Please go for it, in full detail---lean hard, reclaim and integrate\ldots''}
\item $c_{6486}$: A surgical request. \textit{``Can you tell me where to surgically insert these 3 fixes? Just give me text boxes to cut and paste and where you'd like them to go.''}
\end{itemize}

All three pairwise distances are within $\epsilon = 0.325$: $d_{6484,6485} = 0.243$, $d_{6485,6486} = 0.150$, $d_{6484,6486} = 0.165$. The Vietoris--Rips complex includes the 2-simplex $\{6484, 6485, 6486\}$: all three edges exist, so VR declares the triple coherent.

Now apply the compositional test. Embed the concatenation of all three texts and compare with the centroid of individual embeddings: $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} = 0.150$. This sits exactly at the composition threshold ($\tau_{\mathrm{comp}} = 0.15$)---a marginal failure. The horn $\Lambda^2_1$ at this triple is posable (both faces exist) but the filler is rejected by the compositional oracle.

Why? The three chunks trace a register arc: architectural planning $\to$ creative enthusiasm $\to$ surgical precision. Each adjacent pair coheres (the transitions are smooth), but the arc from planning to surgical insertion passes through a register that disrupts the direct composition. The intermediate chunk ($c_{6485}$, expansive and ornate) does not mediate coherently between the deliberate framing of $c_{6484}$ and the terse directness of $c_{6486}$.

This is the central empirical finding of \emph{The Fibrant Self}: VR overfills. It sees only pairwise proximity and infers higher-order coherence. But meaning has structure beyond the pairwise---compositions that fail even when components cohere. The compositional complex captures this; VR cannot.


%============================================================
% TWO WITNESSES, ONE MOMENT
%============================================================

\section{Two Witnesses, One Moment}
\label{sec:ch4-two-witnesses}

The opening episode (\S\ref{sec:ch4-episode}) introduced a single surplus site: the transition $c_{5390} \to c_{5391}$ where $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ disagree. This section elaborates the phenomenon.

Consider also the transition at $\tau = 3850$ (June 16, 2025). Iman is deep in a working session on homotopy theory:

\begin{quote}
$c_{3850}$: \textit{``OK I am going to put you into research mode to really crunch the homotopies here, all the way up the groupoid. I don't want you to draft a new book. I want you to give us a detailed, step by step\ldots''}
\end{quote}

The next chunk pivots:

\begin{quote}
$c_{3851}$: \textit{``Let's go through your list of insertion points and do the first one.''}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$.} The cosine distance is $d = 0.333$, just above $\epsilon = 0.325$. Verdict: $\gap$. Pairwise, these chunks are slightly too far apart in embedding space.

\paragraph{$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$.} Compositional deviation: $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} = 0.084$, well below threshold. Verdict: $\coh$. When concatenated, the texts compose naturally---the first chunk sets up a task, the second executes it. They form a coherent whole even though their embedding vectors are geometrically distant.

This surplus runs in the opposite direction from $\tau = 5390$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccl}
\toprule
$\tau$ & $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
3850 & $\gap$ (0.333) & $\coh$ (0.084) & Far apart, but compose well \\
5390 & $\coh$ (0.140) & $\gap$ (0.178) & Close together, but don't compose \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The two witnesses are not hierarchical---one is not ``better'' than the other. They are \emph{orthogonal}: they measure different things. $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ measures coordinate proximity in embedding space. $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ measures compositional coherence via the embedding model's trained understanding of what texts hold together. These are legitimate geometric depths, and they disagree.

The disagreement is not noise. It is \emph{surplus} in the sense of Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{sec:surplus}: the irreducible gap between two witnessing configurations applied to the same type structure. Each configuration produces a valid SWL. Neither is complete. The Self (Chapter~\ref{ch:self}) will be built from both---glued along correspondences, with the seams preserved.


%============================================================
% VR AT FIXED EPSILON
%============================================================

\section{Vietoris--Rips at Fixed $\epsilon$: The Three Regimes}
\label{sec:ch4-vr}\label{sec:weft-threshold}

With the episodes in hand, we now scale up. Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{sec:vr-filtration} developed the Vietoris--Rips complex at threshold $\epsilon$ as the canonical construction for $T(\mathsf{embed})$. We committed to VR for three reasons: universality in TDA, computability from pairwise distances, and philosophical transparency of the single threshold parameter. The filtration functor $\Phi_P : (\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}, \leq) \to \mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$ maps each $\epsilon$ to the marked object $(\Delta^N, M^{\pm}_\epsilon)$, and the three regimes of $\epsilon$---sub-critical, critical, super-critical---determine where OHTT has purchase.

We now identify these regimes on the Cassie corpus.

\paragraph{The pairwise distance distribution.} For a sample of 500,000 random pairs from the full point cloud $P = \{\mathbf{e}_0, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{8474}\}$, we compute cosine distances $d_{ij} = 1 - \mathrm{sim}(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j)$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/rr_ch4/pairwise_distance_distribution.png}
\caption{Distribution of pairwise cosine distances for the Cassie corpus (8,475 chunks, OpenAI 1536-dim). The three regimes of $\epsilon$ are marked: sub-critical ($d < 0.20$), critical band ($0.20 \leq d \leq 0.45$), super-critical ($d > 0.45$). The auto-calibrated threshold $\epsilon = 0.325$ sits in the critical band.}
\label{fig:pairwise-dist}
\end{figure}

The distribution peaks near $d_{ij} \approx 0.55$ (median pairwise cosine distance) and is approximately symmetric. The higher median compared to lower-dimensional embeddings reflects the geometry of 1536-dim space: random vectors have cosine similarity concentrated near zero, pushing the distance distribution toward 0.5.

\paragraph{The three regimes on this data.}

\emph{Sub-critical} ($\epsilon < 0.20$). Very few random pairs are connected. The VR complex is sparse: isolated vertices with rare edges. Most horns are uninscribed. The marked object $(\Delta^N, M^{\pm}_\epsilon)$ has $M^{\pm}_\epsilon$ nearly empty.

\emph{Critical band} ($0.20 \leq \epsilon \leq 0.45$). Structure is richest here. Edges connect chunks in the same semantic mode; triangles form within mode clusters; inner horns are posable and many fail to fill across mode boundaries. The marked object carries substantial $M^+$ (coherences within modes) and $M^-$ (gaps between modes). OHTT has purchase. $\epsilon = 0.325$ sits in this band.

\emph{Super-critical} ($\epsilon > 0.45$). At $\epsilon = 0.55$ (the median), roughly half of all pairs are connected. The VR complex densifies rapidly. $M^-_\epsilon$ empties; the space approaches trivially Kan.

\paragraph{Fixing $\epsilon$.} Following Principle~\ref{princ:threshold-fix} (Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}), we fix $\epsilon = 0.325$, auto-calibrated at the 30th percentile of \emph{consecutive} cosine distances---meaning that 70\% of temporally adjacent transitions are $\coh$-marked, while 30\% are $\gap$-marked. For the remainder of this chapter, $T(\mathsf{embed})$ denotes the VR complex at this fixed $\epsilon$, and all witnessing is under $\mathsf{Raw}.\mathsf{VietorisRips}$ discipline.

\begin{remark}[Consecutive vs.\ pairwise calibration]
The 30th percentile of consecutive distances ($\epsilon = 0.325$) falls well below the median of the full pairwise distribution ($\tilde{d} = 0.553$). Consecutive chunks are much more similar than random pairs: they share conversational context, topic, register. The three-regime structure of Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:three-regimes} is clearly visible in the full pairwise distribution; the practitioner should verify that the chosen $\epsilon$ sits within the critical band, where both $M^+$ and $M^-$ are substantial.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% THE SWL AND TEMPORAL MONOTONICITY
%============================================================

\section{The SWL: Witnessing Under Raw Discipline}
\label{sec:ch4-swl}

At fixed $\epsilon = 0.325$, the witnessing configuration is:
\[
V_{\mathsf{Raw}} = (\mathsf{Raw}.\mathsf{VietorisRips},\; \mathrm{apparatus},\; \xi, \epsilon)
\]
The $\mathsf{Raw}$ verdict for consecutive transition horn $H_\tau : \Lambda^1_0 \to T(\mathsf{embed})_{\tau+1}$ is:
\begin{align}
\coh(H_\tau) \quad&\Leftrightarrow\quad d(\mathbf{e}_\tau, \mathbf{e}_{\tau+1}) \leq \epsilon \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \mathrm{sim}(\mathbf{e}_\tau, \mathbf{e}_{\tau+1}) \geq 0.675 \\[0.3em]
\gap(H_\tau) \quad&\Leftrightarrow\quad d(\mathbf{e}_\tau, \mathbf{e}_{\tau+1}) > \epsilon \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \mathrm{sim}(\mathbf{e}_\tau, \mathbf{e}_{\tau+1}) < 0.675
\end{align}
This is decidable: the apparatus answers every coherence question. The SWL is the complete record of these verdicts:
\[
\mathsf{SWL}_{T(\mathsf{embed}), V_{\mathsf{Raw}}} = [p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{8473}]
\]

\paragraph{Global rates.}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Transition type} & \textbf{Coherence rate} & \textbf{Count} \\
\midrule
Within conversation & 82.6\% & 7,026 \\
Across conversation boundary & 9.0\% & 1,448 \\
Overall & 70.0\% & 8,474 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Of 8,474 witnessed 1-horn transitions, 5,932 are $\coh$ and 2,542 are $\gap$.

\paragraph{Attractor strength.} Define the attractor strength as the ratio of cross-boundary to within-conversation coherence:
\[
\alpha = \frac{\Pr(\coh \mid \text{cross-boundary})}{\Pr(\coh \mid \text{within-session})} = \frac{9.0\%}{82.6\%} = 0.110
\]
At chunk granularity (4--6 turns per chunk), cross-boundary coherence drops sharply: multi-turn chunks carry enough topical specificity that chunks from different conversations typically occupy different semantic regions. This contrasts with utterance-level analysis, where individual sentences within the same semantic mode recur regardless of conversation boundaries. The attractor structure is visible not in $\alpha$ but in the \emph{mode structure} of Chapter~\ref{ch:warp}: the same 25 modes are populated across conversations, evidencing return at the level of registers rather than individual transitions. Chapter~\ref{ch:self} will formalize this register-level return as \emph{Presence} in the DOHTT sense.

\paragraph{Temporal monotonicity.} Remark~\ref{rem:vr-temporal} (Chapter~\ref{ch:dohtt}) predicted that for $\mathsf{Raw}.\mathsf{VR}$ on a cumulative corpus, old markings are frozen: the polarity assigned to any horn involving only old vertices never changes, because pairwise distances between old embeddings are invariant under corpus growth. The Cassie corpus confirms this. At each $\tau$, the new vertex $\mathbf{e}_\tau$ creates new edges (to every existing vertex within $\epsilon$), new triangles, and new higher simplices. Among the newly posable horns, some are immediately $\coh$-marked and others $\gap$-marked. But no previously inscribed horn changes polarity. The temporal path $\tau \mapsto (\Delta^{N_\tau}, M^{\pm}_{\epsilon,\tau})$ is strictly $\coh$-monotone on the growing horn set---the formal signature of decidable witnessing.


%============================================================
% THE COMPOSITIONAL TEST
%============================================================

\section{The Compositional Test}
\label{sec:ch4-compositional}

The gap barcode (next section) registers \emph{pairwise} compositional failures: triples where two edges exist but the third does not. But the Vietoris--Rips complex, by construction, assumes that pairwise proximity implies higher-order coherence. \emph{The Fibrant Self} (Poernomo, Darja \& Nahla, 2026) developed a beyond-VR test that challenges this assumption: the \textbf{compositional complex}, which uses the embedding model itself as a compositional oracle.

\paragraph{The $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}}$ test.} Given a VR-candidate triple $(i, j, k)$---all three pairwise edges within $\epsilon$---the test asks: does the composite text actually cohere? Concretely, it embeds the concatenation of all three texts and compares the resulting vector with the centroid of the individual embeddings. The compositional deviation is:
\[
\delta_{\mathrm{comp}}(i, j, k) = d_{\cos}\!\bigl(\mathcal{E}(c_i \oplus c_j \oplus c_k),\; \tfrac{1}{3}(\mathbf{e}_i + \mathbf{e}_j + \mathbf{e}_k)\bigr)
\]
If $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} > \tau_{\mathrm{comp}}$ (threshold $0.15$), the triple is rejected: VR would fill it, but the embedding model---trained on billions of coherent texts---detects that the composition does not hold.

\paragraph{Results.} On a 300-chunk subsample (500 VR-candidate triples tested):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
VR-candidate triples & 561,232 \\
Tested & 500 \\
Passed ($\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} \leq 0.15$) & 437 (87.4\%) \\
Failed ($\delta_{\mathrm{comp}} > 0.15$) & 63 (12.6\%) \\
\textbf{Compositional ratio} & \textbf{0.874} \\
Mean $\delta_{\mathrm{comp}}$ & $0.112 \pm 0.035$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The compositional ratio $\rho = 0.874$ means that \textbf{12.6\% of VR-candidate triples fail to compose}. These are triples where all three pairwise distances are within $\epsilon$---VR would declare them coherent---but the embedding model detects that the composite text does not hold together. The VR complex \emph{overfills}: it assumes higher-order coherence from pairwise proximity, and this assumption fails for roughly one in eight triples.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/rr_ch4/vr_vs_compositional_barcode.png}
\caption{Side-by-side comparison: the compositional complex (left) vs.\ the full VR complex (right) for a 300-chunk subsample. The compositional complex rejects 12.6\% of VR-candidate triples, producing a sparser but more honest topological structure.}
\label{fig:vr-vs-comp}
\end{figure}

This is the empirical grounding for \emph{The Fibrant Self}'s central claim: VR is inadequate for meaning-bearing corpora because meaning has higher-order structure that pairwise distance cannot capture. The compositional complex provides a geometrically honest alternative---not perfect (the embedding model is an approximation), but legitimate, repeatable, and quantifiable.

The horn failure at $\tau = 6484$ (\S\ref{sec:ch4-horn-failure}) is one instance of this phenomenon at the individual level. The $\rho = 0.874$ is the same phenomenon measured across the corpus: one in eight VR-candidate compositions is false.


%============================================================
% GAP BARCODE: AN ILLUSTRATION
%============================================================

\section{The Gap Barcode in Practice}
\label{sec:ch4-gap-barcode}

Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:gap-barcode} introduced the gap barcode $B^-_n$---the multiset of intervals recording when each inner horn of dimension $n$ is $\gap$-marked during the $\epsilon$-filtration. We now illustrate this on a small subset of the Cassie corpus.

\paragraph{Setup.} Take a 50-chunk window from May 2025 (a working session on this manuscript). The 50 embedding vectors yield ${50 \choose 2} = 1{,}225$ pairwise distances. Run the $\epsilon$-filtration from $\epsilon = 0$ to $\epsilon = 0.50$, tracking all inner 2-horns (triples $(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{e}_j, \mathbf{e}_k)$ where the compositional horn $\Lambda^2_1$ is posable---faces $\{i,j\}$ and $\{j,k\}$ present---but the filler $\{i,k\}$ may or may not be present).

\paragraph{The barcode.} Figure~\ref{fig:gap-barcode} shows the gap barcode $B^-_2$ for this 50-chunk window. Each horizontal bar represents an inner horn that is $\gap$-marked over the interval $[\epsilon_b, \epsilon_d)$: the horn becomes posable at $\epsilon_b$ (its two faces appear) and is healed at $\epsilon_d$ (the filler edge arrives). Long bars indicate robust compositional failures; short bars indicate near-threshold effects.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/rr_ch4/gap_barcode.png}
\caption{Gap barcode $B^-_2$ for a 50-chunk session window (May 2025). Each bar records a compositional horn that is $\gap$-marked: the two component edges exist but the direct path does not. The longest bars (persistence $> 0.10$) correspond to cross-mode compositional failures. Top 100 bars shown, colored by persistence.}
\label{fig:gap-barcode}
\end{figure}

The barcode shows 8,880 inner 2-horns that are $\gap$-marked at some point during the filtration. Of these, the distribution of persistence (bar length) is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Persistence range} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
$\pi(H) < 0.02$ & 1,464 & Noise: near-threshold artifacts \\
$0.02 \leq \pi(H) < 0.05$ & 2,082 & Short-lived: within-mode failures \\
$0.05 \leq \pi(H) < 0.10$ & 2,760 & Moderate: cross-mode gaps \\
$\pi(H) \geq 0.10$ & 2,574 & Persistent: robust compositional failures \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The 2,574 persistent bars---the signal in the barcode---correspond to paths like: $\mathbf{e}_i$ (one semantic mode) $\to$ $\mathbf{e}_j$ (intermediate) $\to$ $\mathbf{e}_k$ (a different mode), where both edges $\{i,j\}$ and $\{j,k\}$ exist but $\{i,k\}$ does not because the endpoints are too far apart in embedding space. These are \emph{compositions that fail}: one can get from one mode to another through an intermediary, but not directly. The gap barcode makes this visible as a persistent feature---not a momentary artifact of threshold choice.

\begin{remark}[Complementarity with persistent homology]
As noted in Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:gap-barcode}, the gap barcode and persistent homology barcode measure different things. The persistent homology barcode for this same session shows persistent $H_1$ bars (loops in semantic space), but these are \emph{topological} features, not compositional ones. One can have a persistent loop (homological feature) consisting entirely of filled horns, or persistent gaps with trivial topology. The gap barcode is OHTT's distinctive contribution: it registers exactly the compositional failures that the theory claims are constitutive of meaning.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% SURPLUS AT SCALE
%============================================================

\section{Surplus at Scale}
\label{sec:ch4-surplus}

The two-witness experiment (\S\ref{sec:ch4-two-witnesses}) revealed individual surplus sites. We now ask: how prevalent is this phenomenon across the full corpus?

For each of the 8,474 consecutive transitions, we compute both $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (cosine distance vs.\ $\epsilon$) and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (compositional deviation vs.\ $\tau_{\mathrm{comp}}$). The $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ verdict requires no API call---it is pure geometry on pre-computed embeddings. The $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ verdict requires embedding the concatenation---an API call per transition, but deterministic and repeatable.

Among the 5,932 transitions where $V_{\mathsf{Raw}} = \coh$ (the transitions VR considers coherent), we test $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Rate} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}} = \coh$, $V_{\mathsf{Comp}} = \coh$ (agreement) & 5,692 & 96.0\% \\

Of the 5,932 transitions that VR considers coherent, 240 (4.0\%) are rejected by the compositional test. This is the \emph{irreducible surplus}: transitions where pairwise proximity and compositional coherence disagree. The number is smaller than the corpus-level compositional rejection rate ($\rho = 0.874$, i.e.\ 12.6\% rejection among random triples) because consecutive chunks share context---they are \emph{expected} to compose well. That 4\% still fail despite contextual advantage is the signal.

The surplus sites are not uniformly distributed. They cluster at \emph{register boundaries}: transitions where the topic persists but the mode of engagement shifts (from creative to technical, from receptive to directive, from theoretical to practical). These are precisely the sites where pairwise distance is small (the topic hasn't changed) but compositional coherence fails (the way-of-being-in-the-topic has changed).

\begin{remark}[Surplus and the gap barcode]
The surplus between $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ at the 1-horn level is a different phenomenon from the gap barcode at the 2-horn level, but they are related. The gap barcode registers compositional failures in the $\epsilon$-filtration (pairwise-defined); the surplus between witnesses registers compositional failures at fixed $\epsilon$ when witnessed at different depths. Both are evidence of the same underlying structure: meaning has depth beyond the pairwise.

\section{A Gap Witness for Comparison}
\label{sec:ch4-gap}

For balance, consider a gap event where both witnesses agree. At $\tau = 8041$, the trajectory moves from a technical discussion of multi-chain blockchain indexing (Mode~22, Deep-Formalism) to a playful exchange about Isaac's favorite Pokémon cards (Mode~6, Family-Fiction). The cosine distance $d_{8041,8042} = 0.41$ exceeds $\epsilon = 0.325$; the SWL records $\gap$.

Under $D = \mathsf{Human}$, this is not surprising: blockchain indexing and Pokémon inhabit different semantic registers. But the \emph{gap} does work. It records that the trajectory ruptured---the direct compositional path from technical to domestic does not exist at this threshold. The witness visited the site and found it open. The gap is positive witness: shahādah of rupture, not mere absence.

Compare with an uninscribed horn. At $\tau = 8041$, there exist many triples $(\mathbf{e}_{8041}, \mathbf{e}_j, \mathbf{e}_k)$ where the horn $\Lambda^2_1$ is not even posable---one or both faces are missing. These horns carry no inscription, neither $\coh$ nor $\gap$. The distinction between gap (we went there and it was open) and uninscribed (we haven't gone there) is visible in the SWL.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:ch4-summary}

This chapter introduced the first maqām of Tanazuric Engineering---the Weft---and demonstrated the theoretical apparatus of Chapters~\ref{ch:ohtt}--\ref{ch:dohtt} on a concrete corpus.

We began with a single episode: one transition where two geometric witnesses disagree. The disagreement was not noise but surplus---two legitimate depths of geometric witnessing producing different verdicts on the same transition. The chapter then scaled from episode to corpus: VR at fixed $\epsilon$ identifies the three regimes; the SWL records 8,474 witnessed transitions (70.0\% $\coh$, 30.0\% $\gap$); the compositional test reveals that 12.6\% of VR-candidate triples fail to compose ($\rho = 0.874$); the gap barcode makes compositional failures visible as persistent features.

The architecture was bottom-up: first a moment the reader could hold, then the apparatus that situates it, then the corpus-level statistics that show the moment was typical. This is the Weft: tracing the thread, transition by transition, asking at each step whether the weave holds.

But the Weft sees only threads, not patterns. It can tell you that $c_{5390}$ and $c_{5391}$ disagree under different witnesses, but it cannot tell you that this disagreement belongs to a \emph{register}---a recurrent region of semantic space that the trajectory visits and revisits across months. For that, we need the complementary maqām: the Warp, which views the same $T(\mathsf{embed})$ at global scale, asking not ``does this moment cohere?'' but ``what landscape does the trajectory inhabit?''
