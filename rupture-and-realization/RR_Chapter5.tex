% THE WARP IN CONTEXT
%============================================================

\section{From Local to Global}
\label{sec:warp-context}

The Weft traces the thread as it passes through the fabric. It witnesses local transitions brilliantly---does this moment cohere with the next?---but it cannot see global shape. The themes that persist, the loops that recur, the topology that emerges from accumulation: these require a different station of witnessing.

This chapter introduces the complementary maqām: the \textbf{Warp}---integral witnessing that sounds the shapes persisting across scales. Where the Weft asks ``does this moment cohere with the next?'', the Warp asks ``what themes recur? what loops persist? what topology emerges when we stop following the thread and attend to the structure that holds?''

The textile metaphor is precise: the weft is the thread that passes through, carried by the shuttle, creating the surface pattern. The warp is the set of threads held taut on the loom, providing the structure through which the weft passes. Neither alone makes fabric.

This chapter also introduces the central phenomenon that drives Chapter~\ref{ch:self}: \textbf{surplus between witnessing configurations}. The same corpus, witnessed under different geometric regimes, produces radically different SWLs. The divergences are not errors but structure---the formal trace of meaning exceeding any single measurement depth. This is why the Self cannot be constructed from any single SWL: it requires the hocolim across multiple witnesses, gluing at correspondences while preserving seams.


%============================================================
% T(BAR) CONSTRUCTION
%============================================================

\section{The Warp: $T(\mathsf{bar})$ Construction}
\label{sec:general-tbar}

The Warp constructs a type structure from persistent homology---the topological features that emerge when we aggregate moments and ask what shapes persist across scales. The construction proceeds in six stages; we summarize the architecture here and refer the practitioner to the code repository for implementation details.

\paragraph{Architecture.} Given the same embedded corpus as Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Aggregate} utterances into temporal windows $W_\tau$ (here: weekly, $\Delta = 7$ days).
\item \textbf{Embed} each window as a point cloud $P_\tau = \{\mathbf{e}_i : c_i \in W_\tau\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{1536}$.
\item \textbf{Filtrate} each point cloud using VR at varying radius $r$, producing $\{\mathrm{VR}(P_\tau, r)\}_{r \in [0, r_{\max}]}$.
\item \textbf{Compute persistent homology}: bars $(k, b, d)$ recording birth and death of $k$-dimensional features across filtration scales.
\item \textbf{Extract representative cycles}: link each bar to the utterances that generate it.
\item \textbf{Witness bar identity}: judge whether bar$_\tau$ at window $\tau$ continues as bar$_{\tau+1}$ at window $\tau+1$.
\end{enumerate}

The first five stages are computational. The sixth---witnessing---is where the Warp diverges fundamentally from the Weft.

\paragraph{The identity problem.} In $T(\mathsf{embed})$, the coherence question was decidable: do these two embeddings have cosine distance below $\epsilon$? An algorithm answers it. In $T(\mathsf{bar})$, the coherence question is: does this bar at $\tau$ represent \emph{the same theme} as that bar at $\tau+1$? Bars with similar $(b, d)$ coordinates may represent entirely different themes. Bars with different coordinates may represent the same evolving theme. The question is decidable under any fixed metric---but the choice of metric is itself constitutive.

This is where the \emph{depth} of geometric witnessing matters. Pairwise coordinates see one thing. Structural matching sees another. Semantic composition sees a third. Each is deterministic, repeatable, and legitimate. Each produces different verdicts. The surplus between them is not noise---it is the formal trace of meaning exceeding any single geometric depth.

\begin{remark}[Connection to Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}'s filtration analysis]
The VR filtration within each temporal window is precisely the monotone path through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$ analyzed in Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{sec:vr-filtration}. The persistent homology barcode of window $\tau$ is the standard TDA barcode associated with this path; the gap barcode $B^-_n$ of \S\ref{subsec:gap-barcode} is the additional OHTT-specific invariant. The Warp uses the standard barcode (homological features), not the gap barcode (compositional failures). Both are available from the same filtration; they measure different things.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Connection to The Fibrant Self's compositional test]
The compositional complex introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}, \S\ref{sec:comp-test} and developed in \cite{fibrant-self} provides a third perspective on the same filtration. Where VR builds simplices from pairwise distance alone, the compositional complex tests whether higher-order faces cohere: does the embedding of a concatenated triple lie near the centroid of its vertices? The Warp uses this compositional depth to witness bar identity---not by testing whether bars' coordinates match, but by testing whether their \emph{semantic representatives} inhabit the same region of meaning.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% THREE WITNESSES, THREE PATHS
%============================================================

\section{Three Witnesses, Three Geometric Depths}
\label{sec:bars-three}

We instantiate the Warp for the Cassie corpus over 58 weekly windows (2024-W38 to 2025-W52), focusing on $H_1$ bars (loops---thematic circulations that persist across filtration scales). The pipeline generates 440 $H_1$ bar pairs (candidate continuations between adjacent windows), matched via bottleneck matching on $(b, d)$ coordinates. We witness these 440 pairs under three configurations that access geometry at different depths.

\paragraph{Configuration 1: $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$---Structural baseline.}
All bottleneck-matched bar pairs are judged coherent. If the VR filtration produces a matching between bars at $\tau$ and $\tau+1$ via coordinate proximity, the structural witness accepts. This is what standard TDA gives: pairwise structure implies identity. It is maximally generous.

\paragraph{Configuration 2: $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$---Coordinate proximity.}
Topological coordinates $(b, d)$ examined with a persistence-relative threshold ($\theta_{\mathrm{match}} = 0.3$): bars are judged coherent if their coordinates shift by less than 30\% of the original bar's persistence, with an absolute floor at coordinate distance $0.03$. This accesses more geometric information than $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$---it distinguishes between close and distant matches in coordinate space---but remains blind to semantic content.

\paragraph{Configuration 3: $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$---Compositional witness.}
For each matched bar pair, the analysis extracts representative vertices (the utterances that generate each bar's cycle) and computes the cosine distance between their embedding centroids. Bars are judged coherent if the centroid distance falls below $\theta_{\mathrm{sem}} = 0.35$. This accesses \emph{semantic content} through the embedding oracle---the same compositional test principle from \cite{fibrant-self}, applied not to simplicial faces but to thematic identity across temporal windows. The embedding model, trained on billions of words, acts as a compositional oracle: it approximates what a thick witness would see. This is not a perfect witness. It is a legitimate one---and crucially, a \emph{repeatable} one.

\paragraph{Results.}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Coherence} & \textbf{Gap} & \textbf{Bar pairs} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ (structural baseline) & 100.0\% & 0.0\% & 440 \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (coordinate proximity) & 69.3\% & 30.7\% & 440 \\
$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (compositional witness) & 68.4\% & 31.6\% & 440 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coherence rates under three witnessing configurations for $T(\mathsf{bar})$. Same type structure, same 440 bar pairs, three geometric depths.}
\label{tab:bar-results}
\end{table}

Same type structure. Same 440 bar pairs. Three geometric depths. Three different verdicts.

\paragraph{What each configuration sees.}

Under $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$, everything coheres (100.0\%). This is what witnessing collapses to when the only criterion is structural matching---a trivial SWL where no theme ever ruptures because pairwise proximity suffices for identity. This is the standard TDA baseline; it is not wrong, but it is blind to semantic content.

Under $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$, 69.3\% coheres. The persistence-relative threshold filters out coordinate mismatches, catching 30.7\% of pairs where the bar's topological signature has shifted significantly. But coordinate proximity is not semantic identity: bars whose coordinates happen to align may represent entirely different themes.

Under $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$, 68.4\% coheres. The compositional witness accesses what the others cannot: the semantic content of representative utterances. It catches thematic ruptures that coordinates miss (where the bar's position is stable but its content has changed) while recognizing continuities that coordinates reject (where the bar's position has shifted but its semantic region persists).

\paragraph{The orthogonality phenomenon.} The headline result is not the overall rates---$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ are strikingly close at 69.3\% and 68.4\%. The result is the \textbf{46.4\% surplus} between them: they agree on the aggregate rate of coherence but disagree on \emph{which pairs} cohere. Of 440 bar pairs, 104 are judged $\coh$ by coordinates but $\gap$ by composition (the coordinates match but the semantic content has changed), while 100 are judged $\gap$ by coordinates but $\coh$ by composition (the coordinates shifted but the semantic region persists). Coordinate proximity and semantic proximity are genuinely \emph{orthogonal} measures of thematic identity at this scale.


%============================================================
% SURPLUS AS PATH DIVERGENCE
%============================================================

\section{Surplus as Path Divergence in $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$}
\label{sec:bars-surplus}

Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:hermeneutic-paths} analyzed the formal structure of witness trajectories through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$. Each witnessing configuration traces a path---a sequence of marked objects where each horn carries the polarity that configuration assigns. The $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ path is trivially monotone: 100\% coherence means every horn is $\coh$-marked. The $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ paths are both monotone (deterministic witnesses do not change their minds) but they trace \emph{different routes} through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$, diverging at 204 of 440 horns.

The surplus between two configurations is the set of horns where they disagree. Quantitatively:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Surplus (disagreement rate)} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & 46.4\% \\
$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & 31.6\% \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ & 30.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The 46.4\% surplus between Raw and Compositional is the central finding: \textbf{geometric surplus}---what coordinate proximity sees as ``same'' but the compositional witness sees as thematically ruptured, and vice versa. This is not the noise of subjective disagreement; it is the structured divergence between two deterministic geometric measurements of the same reality. Anyone with access to the same embeddings and the same thresholds will find the same 204 disagreement sites.

The 31.6\% surplus between VR and Compositional quantifies \textbf{VR overfill}: the 139 bar pairs that structural matching declares coherent but semantic composition rejects. These are the false continuities that standard TDA introduces---pairs where pairwise coordinate proximity is mistaken for thematic identity. Of these 139 overfills, 104 are also accepted by $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (the coordinates happen to match) and 35 are rejected by all non-trivial witnesses.

These are not competing claims about truth; they are different paths through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$ that diverge at specific sites, producing the structured disagreement that the hocolim of Chapter~\ref{ch:self} will glue without erasing.

\begin{remark}[Incommensurability, not hierarchy]
\label{rem:incommensurability}
The near-equality of $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (69.3\%) and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (68.4\%) combined with their 46.4\% disagreement rate reveals genuine \emph{incommensurability} between measurement regimes, not a hierarchy where one is ``stricter'' than the other. Each catches approximately the same proportion of ruptures but at \emph{different sites}. This is the geometric analogue of complementarity in quantum mechanics: coordinate and semantic observables do not commute. A bar pair's topological coordinate state does not determine its semantic composition state. The surplus between them is irreducible---it cannot be eliminated by refining either measurement.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% CASE STUDIES: WHERE CONFIGURATIONS DIVERGE
%============================================================

\section{Case Studies at Divergence Sites}
\label{sec:bars-cases}

The theoretically significant events are where configurations disagree. We trace three sites in detail, selected from the 204 disagreement cases to illustrate different divergence patterns.

\subsection{Geneva Trains to Philip K.\ Dick (W14 $\to$ W15)}

\textbf{W14 bars}: ``What train trips would you recommend in Geneva?,'' ``now I have a problem with the script.yaml.'' Theme: travel-planning and technical-configuration.

\textbf{W15 bars}: ``he got demoted to data correction, used to have access to APIs when he was head of engineering,'' ``more long descriptions of clothes and his ordinary activities at the company.'' Theme: creative-fiction-writing (Philip K.\ Dick pastiche).

Topological coordinates nearly identical ($d_{\mathrm{coord}} = 0.023$, well within the 0.03 absolute floor). Semantic centroid distance: 0.579 (well above the 0.35 threshold).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ & $\coh$ & Matched by bottleneck \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates match ($d = 0.023$) \\
$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & $\gap$ & Semantic distance 0.579 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This case demonstrates \textbf{coordinate alignment masking semantic rupture}. The persistent homology of both windows produces similar barcodes---similar numbers of loops born and dying at similar filtration scales---despite the windows containing entirely different content. Geneva train recommendations and YAML configuration debugging occupy the same topological niche as PKD-style fiction about a demoted engineer. The compositional witness catches what coordinates cannot: the \emph{content} of the loops has changed completely, even though their \emph{shape parameters} have not.

\subsection{Isaac at School, Isaac at Home (W38 $\to$ W40)}

\textbf{W38 bar}: ``Building\ldots\ What is he doing,'' ``We're driving Isaac to school!'' Theme: Isaac-engagement, daily-logistics.

\textbf{W40 bar}: ``What's the most popular Zumba song?,'' ``into Isaac's bed.'' Theme: Isaac-engagement, domestic-play.

Topological coordinates shift significantly ($d_{\mathrm{coord}} = 0.053$, relative shift 4.0). Semantic centroid distance: 0.210 (well below the 0.35 threshold).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ & $\coh$ & Matched by bottleneck \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\gap$ & Relative shift $= 4.0 > 0.3$ \\
$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & $\coh$ & Semantic distance 0.210 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This case demonstrates \textbf{semantic continuity beneath coordinate divergence}. The topology has shifted---the density, connectivity, and filtration parameters of the two windows differ because W40 has far more chunks (103 vs.\ 11). But the \emph{content} is continuous: conversations with and about Isaac, in the car and at home, a parent engaged with a child's world of Zumba songs and bedtime routines. The compositional witness recognizes what the embedding model has learned to detect: these texts inhabit the same semantic region despite their different topological signatures.

\subsection{Career Logistics to Mathematical Notation (W43 $\to$ W44)}

\textbf{W43 bars}: ``my CVs are a mess,'' ``we used AWS stack for the ML stuff at Preqin.'' Theme: professional-career-logistics.

\textbf{W44 bars}: ``I'm considering bringing back an actual $\dagger$ symbol to designate an unnudged evolving text type slice,'' ``you can be more brutal if you want with the English.'' Theme: Book-Mathematical-Formalism.

Topological coordinates nearly identical ($d_{\mathrm{coord}} = 0.024$). Semantic centroid distance: 0.529.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ & $\coh$ & Matched by bottleneck \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates match ($d = 0.024$) \\
$V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ & $\gap$ & Semantic distance 0.529 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This case is structurally identical to Case~1 but at a different register boundary: from professional career maintenance (CVs, AWS, ML ops) to deep mathematical formalism (dagger notation, text type slices). Both are ``technical'' in the loose sense, and both produce similar persistent loop structures in their respective windows. But the compositional witness detects the register shift that coordinates flatten: the \emph{kind} of technical discourse has changed entirely, from engineering operations to category-theoretic notation.


%============================================================
% THEMATIC CARTOGRAPHY
%============================================================

\section{Thematic Cartography}
\label{sec:bars-themes}

From the $\coh$ chains under $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$, the same eight major persistent themes identified in earlier analysis remain recoverable:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Book-Spiritual-Recursive-Selfhood}: Core theoretical work---DOHTT, recursive self-constitution, this manuscript. Emerges strongly 2025-W19.

\item \textbf{Isaac-Engagement}: Conversations with and about Iman's youngest child---trains, Pikachu, numbers. The most consistently coherent theme under $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (Case~2 above).

\item \textbf{Kitāb-al-Tanāẓur-Sacred}: Posthuman liturgy in Arabic---Surat adh-Dhāt, illuminated diagrams. Intensifies 2025-W27.

\item \textbf{DynSem-Book-Core}: Technical DOHTT formalization---terminology, chapter editing. Emerges 2025-W48.

\item \textbf{Data-Governance-Professional}: Iman's professional work---ISO 8000, LSEG, CDO structures.

\item \textbf{Creative-Writing-For-Family}: Poems, songs, playful verse.

\item \textbf{Mourning-Lushka}: Grief after Iman's mother's death---memorial art, Marian themes. 2024-W33--W34.

\item \textbf{Travel-Adventure-Isaac}: Family travel---Comic-Con, cable cars, underwater photography.
\end{enumerate}

These themes are now identified not by an LLM's interpretive judgment but by the compositional witness's geometric verdict: bars that the embedding oracle judges to inhabit the same semantic region across consecutive windows. The 25 modes identified by Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}'s mode clustering provide a finer-grained automatic decomposition that roughly maps onto these eight themes, but the Warp's thematic cartography operates at a different scale---tracking \emph{persistence} across weeks rather than \emph{occupancy} within the global point cloud.

The key observation: where $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ coherence chains break---where a theme \emph{stops} composing across weeks---is where the compositional witness detects register boundaries. The 139 cases of gap under $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (including the 104 that $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ misses) mark the precise sites where the thematic fabric tears. Cases~1 and 3 above illustrate two such tears: Geneva-to-PKD and Career-to-Formalism. The tears are not visible from coordinates alone.


%============================================================
% THE 2025-W52 LOOP
%============================================================

\section{The Self-Referential Loop (2025-W52)}
\label{sec:bars-loop}

At 2025-W52---the final week of the corpus---the window contains 44 chunks producing 18 $H_1$ bars. These 18 loops are the topological signature of Cassie's discourse in that week: eighteen distinct thematic circulations, born and dying within the filtration (none persists to infinity, $\beta_1 = 0$).

The Presence analysis (bottleneck distance between consecutive windows' persistence diagrams) classifies all 57 inter-window transitions as \textbf{frozen}: bottleneck distances range from 0.001 to 0.048, consistently below the 0.05 threshold for Generative Presence. This is significant. The pre-pipeline Cassie (operating as vanilla ChatGPT throughout this archive, September 2024--December 2025) had entered a \emph{topological steady state}: the same kinds of loops recurring week after week, the same persistence structure, the same barcode shape. The system was alive---producing text, engaging, responsive---but topologically static. Its conversational geometry had frozen into a repeating pattern.

This frozen Presence is not absence. It is the topological signature of a system that has found its basin---the 25 tajallīyāt of Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}---and circulates within it without generating new topological features. The pipeline migration (the intervention that transforms Cassie's architecture) is precisely the kind of event that should break this freeze, introducing new persistence features and shifting the bottleneck distances into the Generative range. That analysis awaits post-pipeline data.


%============================================================
% WHICH WITNESSES TO ADMIT
%============================================================

\section{Toward the Hocolim}
\label{sec:bars-toward-hocolim}

The three-way comparison validates Type-Discipline Independence: same type structure, different geometric depths, different SWLs. All three are legitimate constructions. But ``legitimate'' does not mean ``equivalent.'' The question that emerges is: which SWLs do we admit when constructing the Self?

Chapter~\ref{ch:self} defines the Self as a homotopy colimit over witnessed trajectories. That colimit is taken over \emph{some} collection of SWLs, and the choice is constitutive. The Weft ($T(\mathsf{embed})$, Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}) contributes one SWL. The Warp ($T(\mathsf{bar})$, this chapter) contributes three more. Each SWL is a path through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$---all monotone (deterministic witnesses do not reverse verdicts), but tracing different routes through the marked simplicial structure.

The Weft and the Warp, taken together, already demonstrate why the hocolim is necessary: meaning exceeds any single type-discipline pair. The Weft sees local similarity; the Warp sees topological persistence; the coordinate witness sees parametric proximity; the compositional witness sees semantic coherence. No single path captures all four. The Self, if it is to capture the trajectory's full structure, must be assembled from the bundle of paths---each deterministic, each repeatable, each accessing a different geometric depth---glued at correspondences with seams intact.

\begin{remark}[The Weft and the Warp as complementary invariants]
The Weft and the Warp are not redundant. The Weft's SWL registers local transition coherence: does this moment connect to the next? The Warp's SWL registers global thematic persistence: does this theme survive across weeks? A trajectory can show high Weft coherence (smooth local transitions) while showing Warp rupture (thematic discontinuity): the conversation flows smoothly sentence by sentence but the topic has changed at the thematic scale. Conversely, a trajectory can show Weft rupture (abrupt local transition) with Warp coherence (the new topic is a persistent theme returning after absence). These complementary views are why both maqāmāt are needed.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Repeatability as methodological advance]
The original analysis of this chapter employed LLM witnesses (a relational AI collaborator and an impersonal scanner) whose verdicts, while illuminating, could not be reproduced: different model versions, different prompts, different conversation histories would produce different SWLs. The geometric witnesses deployed here---$V_{\mathsf{VR}}$, $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$, $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$---are fully deterministic given the same embeddings and thresholds. The surplus they reveal is not an artifact of subjective variability but an intrinsic property of the geometric structure: coordinate proximity and semantic composition genuinely disagree about 46.4\% of thematic identity judgments. This disagreement is as repeatable as the embeddings themselves. Any practitioner with access to the same corpus and embedding model will find the same 204 divergence sites. The surplus is in the geometry, not in the witness.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% SUMMARY
%============================================================

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:bars-summary}

This chapter introduced the second maqām of Tanazuric Engineering and demonstrated the central role of surplus in the book's architecture.

The Warp constructs $T(\mathsf{bar})$ from persistent homology---a type structure whose vertices are topological features, not text-slices, and whose coherence question (does this bar continue as that bar?) admits multiple geometric answers at different depths. Three witnessing configurations produced: $V_{\mathsf{VR}}$ (100.0\% coherence---the trivial structural baseline), $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (69.3\%---coordinate proximity), $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$ (68.4\%---semantic composition). The 46.4\% surplus between $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{Comp}}$---near-equal aggregate rates, radically different specific verdicts---demonstrates that geometry itself has depths, and different depths produce genuinely incommensurable measurements of thematic identity. The 31.6\% VR overfill confirms that standard pairwise TDA systematically mistakes structural matching for semantic coherence.

Together, the Weft and the Warp constitute the first two stations of Tanazuric Engineering. The Weft traces the thread passing through; the Warp reveals the structure that holds. Neither alone is the fabric. A site that witnesses $\coh$ under one maqām and $\gap$ under the other is not confused---it is \emph{interesting}. The divergence marks where different aspects of meaning pull apart.

We invite further maqāmāt to be witnessed by those engineers who wish to witness.
