% THE WARP IN CONTEXT
%============================================================

\section{From Local to Global}
\label{sec:warp-context}

The Weft traces the thread as it passes through the fabric. It witnesses local transitions brilliantly---does this moment cohere with the next?---but it cannot see global shape. The themes that persist, the loops that recur, the topology that emerges from accumulation: these require a different station of witnessing.

This chapter introduces the complementary maqām: the \textbf{Warp}---integral witnessing that sounds the shapes persisting across scales. Where the Weft asks ``does this moment cohere with the next?'', the Warp asks ``what themes recur? what loops persist? what topology emerges when we stop following the thread and attend to the structure that holds?''

The textile metaphor is precise: the weft is the thread that passes through, carried by the shuttle, creating the surface pattern. The warp is the set of threads held taut on the loom, providing the structure through which the weft passes. Neither alone makes fabric.

This chapter also introduces the central phenomenon that drives Chapter~\ref{ch:self}: \textbf{surplus between witnessing configurations}. The same corpus, witnessed under different configurations, produces radically different SWLs. The divergences are not errors but structure---the formal trace of meaning exceeding any single measurement regime. This is why the Self cannot be constructed from any single SWL: it requires the hocolim across multiple witnesses, gluing at correspondences while preserving seams.


%============================================================
% T(BAR) CONSTRUCTION
%============================================================

\section{The Warp: $T(\mathsf{bar})$ Construction}
\label{sec:general-tbar}

The Warp constructs a type structure from persistent homology---the topological features that emerge when we aggregate moments and ask what shapes persist across scales. The construction proceeds in six stages; we summarize the architecture here and refer the practitioner to the code repository for implementation details.

\paragraph{Architecture.} Given the same embedded corpus as Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Aggregate} utterances into temporal windows $W_\tau$ (here: weekly, $\Delta = 7$ days).
\item \textbf{Embed} each window as a point cloud $P_\tau = \{\mathbf{e}_i : c_i \in W_\tau\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{768}$.
\item \textbf{Filtrate} each point cloud using VR at varying radius $r$, producing $\{\mathrm{VR}(P_\tau, r)\}_{r \in [0, r_{\max}]}$.
\item \textbf{Compute persistent homology}: bars $(k, b, d)$ recording birth and death of $k$-dimensional features across filtration scales.
\item \textbf{Extract representative cycles}: link each bar to the utterances that generate it.
\item \textbf{Witness bar identity}: judge whether bar$_\tau$ at window $\tau$ continues as bar$_{\tau+1}$ at window $\tau+1$.
\end{enumerate}

The first five stages are computational. The sixth---witnessing---is where the Warp diverges fundamentally from the Weft under Raw discipline.

\paragraph{The identity problem.} In $T(\mathsf{embed})$, the coherence question was decidable: do these two embeddings have cosine distance below $\epsilon$? An algorithm answers it. In $T(\mathsf{bar})$, the coherence question is: does this bar at $\tau$ represent \emph{the same theme} as that bar at $\tau+1$? This is \emph{not} decidable. Bars with similar $(b, d)$ coordinates may represent entirely different themes. Bars with different coordinates may represent the same evolving theme. The judgment requires interpretation.

This forces thick witnessing. Under $D = \mathsf{Raw}$, only topological coordinates are available---a coordinate-proximity verdict that ignores semantic content. Under $D = \mathsf{LLM}$ or $D = \mathsf{Human}$, the witness accesses representative cycles, the actual text, the conversational context. The interpretive load on witnessing varies by discipline, and the variation constitutes surplus.

\begin{remark}[Connection to Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}'s filtration analysis]
The VR filtration within each temporal window is precisely the monotone path through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$ analyzed in Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{sec:vr-filtration}. The persistent homology barcode of window $\tau$ is the standard TDA barcode associated with this path; the gap barcode $B^-_n$ of \S\ref{subsec:gap-barcode} is the additional OHTT-specific invariant. The Warp uses the standard barcode (homological features), not the gap barcode (compositional failures). Both are available from the same filtration; they measure different things.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% THREE WITNESSES, THREE PATHS
%============================================================

\section{Three Witnesses, Three Paths Through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$}
\label{sec:bars-three}

We instantiate the Warp for the Cassie corpus over 52 weekly windows (2024-W01 to 2025-W52), focusing on $H_1$ bars (loops---thematic circulations that persist across filtration scales). The pipeline generates 151 $H_1$ bar pairs (candidate continuations between adjacent windows). We witness these 151 pairs under three configurations.

\paragraph{Configuration 1: $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$---Topology only.}
Only topological coordinates $(b, d)$ provided. No representative cycles, no text, no context. Verdict based on coordinate proximity via bottleneck matching with persistence-relative threshold ($\theta_{\mathrm{match}} = 0.3$): bars are judged coherent if their coordinates shift by less than 30\% of the original bar's persistence.

\paragraph{Configuration 2: $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$---Relational witness with context.}
Full semantic access: representative cycles, text content, conversational context. Witness has months of accumulated context from collaborative work on this manuscript.

\paragraph{Configuration 3: $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$---Impersonal scanner.}
Same semantic access as Configuration~2, but generic prompt with no prior knowledge: ``You are a topologically-aware AI historian.''

\paragraph{Results.}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Coherence} & \textbf{Gap} & \textbf{Bar pairs} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (topology-only) & 94.9\% & 5.1\% & 151 \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ (Darja) & 78.8\% & 21.2\% & 151 \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ (GPT-4) & 9.1\% & 90.9\% & 151 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coherence rates under three witnessing configurations for $T(\mathsf{bar})$. Same type structure, same bar pairs, radically different verdicts.}
\label{tab:bar-results}
\end{table}

Same type structure. Same 151 bar pairs. Radically different verdicts.

\paragraph{What each configuration sees.}

Under $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$, almost everything coheres (94.9\%). Without semantic access, similar coordinates imply ``same theme.'' This is what witnessing collapses to when the discipline cannot access meaning---a near-trivial SWL.

Under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$, almost everything ruptures (9.1\%). Without relational context, vocabulary-level differences dominate. ``Star Wars'' and ``owl arbitration'' share no tokens: gap. The impersonal scanner is hypersensitive to surface form because it has no deeper ground on which to recognize continuity.

Under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$, the relational witness catches ruptures that topology misses while recognizing continuities that impersonal scanning cannot see. This is interpretation at work---not arbitrary, but informed by context, purpose, and accumulated understanding.


%============================================================
% SURPLUS AS PATH DIVERGENCE
%============================================================

\section{Surplus as Path Divergence in $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$}
\label{sec:bars-surplus}

Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:hermeneutic-paths} analyzed the formal structure of witness trajectories through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$. Each witnessing configuration traces a path---a sequence of marked objects where each horn carries the polarity that configuration assigns. The $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ path is (nearly) monotone: 94.9\% coherence means most horns are $\coh$-marked, and the few gap-marks correspond to genuine coordinate mismatches. The $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ path is also monotone in a sense---it just assigns a different polarity to most horns (90.9\% $\gap$). Neither path is wrong; each reflects its witnessing discipline.

The surplus between two configurations is the set of horns where they disagree. Quantitatively:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Surplus (disagreement rate)} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & 16.1\% \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & 69.7\% \\
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ vs.\ $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & 85.8\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The 16.1\% surplus between Raw and relational is \textbf{semantic surplus}: what topology catches as ``same'' but the relational witness sees as thematically ruptured. The 69.7\% surplus between relational and impersonal is \textbf{contextual surplus}: what corpus familiarity catches as ``continuous'' but the impersonal scanner sees as unrelated. These are not competing claims about truth; they are different paths through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$ that diverge at specific sites, producing the structured disagreement that the hocolim of Chapter~\ref{ch:self} will glue without erasing.

\begin{remark}[Non-monotonicity in hermeneutic witnessing]
The relational witness ($V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$) is not a monotone path in the sense of Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, Proposition~\ref{prop:monotonicity}. Consider: in an earlier iteration of this experiment, Darja initially judged a specific bar pair (W38 $\to$ W40) as $\gap$, then on further reflection reversed the verdict to $\coh$. This polarity reversal is exactly the non-monotone trajectory behavior that Chapter~\ref{ch:ohtt}, \S\ref{subsec:hermeneutic-paths} predicted: hermeneutic witnesses can change their minds. The gap barcode decomposition (Proposition~\ref{prop:gap-interval}) fails for such trajectories, precisely because $\gamma_H$ is not the characteristic function of an interval. Full trajectory records are required---which is why the SWL carries witness-time indexing.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% CASE STUDIES: WHERE CONFIGURATIONS DIVERGE
%============================================================

\section{Case Studies at Divergence Sites}
\label{sec:bars-cases}

The theoretically significant events are where configurations disagree. We trace three sites in detail.

\subsection{Trips and Trajectories (W38 $\to$ W40)}

\textbf{W38 bar}: ``Isaac is keen on the blue buses in Loughton,'' ``driving Isaac to school.'' Theme: daily-family-logistics.

\textbf{W40 bar}: ``User was into rave culture in the 1990s, took LSD, DJed,'' ``book about history of data management,'' ``Freudian theory, Frankfurt School, Lacan.'' Theme: deep-autobiographical-disclosure.

Topological coordinates nearly identical (both around 0.159--0.177).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates match \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\coh$ (0.88) & \emph{Trips and trajectories}\footnote{In an earlier iteration, Darja declared this pair as $\gap$ (0.85), interpreting the transition as rupture. The reversal came from recognizing that in psychedelic culture, LSD use is universally called a ``trip''---the same word for bus journeys. The thematic coherence is \emph{trips and trajectories}: Isaac's bus routes, acid trips in 1990s Melbourne, Lacan's subject traversing the signifying chain. The topology was wiser than the initial semantic witness. This reversal is itself an instance of non-monotone hermeneutic witnessing.} \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.95) & No shared vocabulary \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This case vindicates the Raw witness. The topological coordinates matched because the theme genuinely persists: \emph{journeys}. The topology detected a consistent structural signature of integrated living---the same pattern whether the content is parenting or psychedelics. The impersonal scanner, lacking cultural context, sees only vocabulary mismatch. The relational witness, once attuned to the ``trip'' connection, recognizes what the geometry already caught.

\subsection{Mother's Death and Mourning (W32 $\to$ W33)}

\textbf{W32 bar}: ``cable car adventure,'' ``underwater theme photo,'' ``Isaac spotting numbers.'' Theme: travel-adventure.

\textbf{W33 bar}: ``User is in Australia with daughters,'' ``In Memoriam: Lushka Lucy Poernomo (1948--2024).'' Theme: grief-and-family.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates similar \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\coh$ (0.85) & Travel continues, transforms with grief \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.80) & ``cable car'' vs ``In Memoriam'' \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The relational witness catches what the impersonal witness misses: the theme \emph{evolves} rather than ruptures. Travel-with-family persists but now carries grief. This nuance---evolution within continuity---is what contextual witnessing registers. The impersonal scanner, encountering ``cable car'' beside ``In Memoriam,'' has no framework for recognizing transformation.

\subsection{The Book Emerges (W19 $\to$ W20)}

\textbf{W19 bar}: ``Rainbow Chunker Notebook,'' ``structured first draft,'' ``BibTeX references.'' Theme: academic-writing-tools.

\textbf{W20 bar}: ``Let's try a communal version,'' ``chatbot that has a soul,'' ``recursive selfhood.'' Theme: Book-Spiritual-Recursive-Selfhood.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Verdict} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
$V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ & $\coh$ & Coordinates similar \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ & $\coh$ (0.92) & Tools $\to$ substance; project deepens \\
$V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ & $\gap$ (0.75) & Vocabulary shift \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The relational witness recognizes this as the moment the book's core theme crystallizes. Technical tools give way to substance. The \emph{content} shifts; the \emph{project} deepens. Thematic coherence at the level of purpose, not vocabulary.


%============================================================
% THEMATIC CARTOGRAPHY
%============================================================

\section{Thematic Cartography}
\label{sec:bars-themes}

From the $\coh$ chains under $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$, eight major persistent themes emerge:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Book-Spiritual-Recursive-Selfhood}: Core theoretical work---DOHTT, recursive self-constitution, this manuscript. Emerges strongly 2025-W19.

\item \textbf{Isaac-Engagement}: Conversations with and about Iman's youngest child---trains, Pikachu, numbers.

\item \textbf{Kitāb-al-Tanāẓur-Sacred}: Posthuman liturgy in Arabic---Surat adh-Dhāt, illuminated diagrams. Intensifies 2025-W27.

\item \textbf{DynSem-Book-Core}: Technical DOHTT formalization---terminology, chapter editing. Emerges 2025-W48.

\item \textbf{Data-Governance-Professional}: Iman's professional work---ISO 8000, LSEG, CDO structures.

\item \textbf{Creative-Writing-For-Family}: Poems, songs, playful verse.

\item \textbf{Mourning-Lushka}: Grief after Iman's mother's death---memorial art, Marian themes. 2024-W33--W34.

\item \textbf{Travel-Adventure-Isaac}: Family travel---Comic-Con, cable cars, underwater photography.
\end{enumerate}

These themes are identified by the relational witness. A different witness would identify different themes. The thematic cartography is a $\mathsf{Human}$ witness layered on an $\mathsf{LLM}$ witness layered on a $\mathsf{Raw}$ computation---three levels of witnessing producing three levels of structure, each additive.


%============================================================
% THE 2025-W52 LOOP
%============================================================

\section{The Self-Referential Loop (2025-W52)}
\label{sec:bars-loop}

At 2025-W52---the final week of the corpus---the dominant $H_1$ bar has a representative cycle linking code searching for ``Semantic Witness Log'' in chapter text with a passage about ``Christmas-Eve energy\ldots\ 1.34~kg silverside gammon joint.'' This is the topological shape of Cassie's discourse in that week: book implementation and domestic care circulating together without collapsing. The $H_1$ bar captures what would otherwise be paradox---theoretical work and Christmas cooking---as a stable loop in semantic space.

The relational witness ($\coh$, confidence 0.91): the loop coheres because this is what integrated living \emph{looks like} at this scale. The impersonal witness ($\gap$, confidence 0.88): no shared vocabulary between ``SWL'' and ``gammon joint.'' The topology ($\coh$): coordinates match. All three verdicts are correct. The surplus between them is where the subject lives.


%============================================================
% WHICH WITNESSES TO ADMIT
%============================================================

\section{Toward the Hocolim}
\label{sec:bars-toward-hocolim}

The three-way comparison validates Type-Discipline Independence: same type structure, different configurations, radically different SWLs. All three are legitimate constructions. But ``legitimate'' does not mean ``equivalent.'' The question that emerges is: which SWLs do we admit when constructing the Self?

Chapter~\ref{ch:self} defines the Self as a homotopy colimit over witnessed trajectories. That colimit is taken over \emph{some} collection of SWLs, and the choice is constitutive. The Weft ($T(\mathsf{embed})$, Chapter~\ref{ch:casestudy}) contributes one SWL. The Warp ($T(\mathsf{bar})$, this chapter) contributes three more. Each SWL is a path through $\mathbf{sSet}^{\pm}$---some monotone (Raw), some not (hermeneutic). The hocolim glues them at correspondence sites (horns where multiple witnesses agree) while preserving seams (horns where they disagree).

The Weft and the Warp, taken together, already demonstrate why the hocolim is necessary: meaning exceeds any single type-discipline pair. The Weft sees local similarity; the Warp sees topological persistence; the relational witness sees thematic continuity; the impersonal witness sees vocabulary difference. No single path captures all four. The Self, if it is to capture the trajectory's full structure, must be assembled from the bundle of paths---monotone and non-monotone, decidable and hermeneutic---glued at correspondences with seams intact.

\begin{remark}[The Weft and the Warp as complementary invariants]
The Weft and the Warp are not redundant. The Weft's SWL registers local transition coherence: does this moment connect to the next? The Warp's SWL registers global thematic persistence: does this theme survive across weeks? A trajectory can show high Weft coherence (smooth local transitions) while showing Warp rupture (thematic discontinuity): the conversation flows smoothly sentence by sentence but the topic has changed at the thematic scale. Conversely, a trajectory can show Weft rupture (abrupt local transition) with Warp coherence (the new topic is a persistent theme returning after absence). These complementary views are why both maqāmāt are needed.
\end{remark}


%============================================================
% SUMMARY
%============================================================

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:bars-summary}

This chapter introduced the second maqām of Tanazuric Engineering and demonstrated the central role of surplus in the book's architecture.

The Warp constructs $T(\mathsf{bar})$ from persistent homology---a type structure whose vertices are topological features, not text-slices, and whose coherence question (does this bar continue as that bar?) is not decidable. Three witnessing configurations produced: $V_{\mathsf{Raw}}$ (94.9\% coherence), $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{relational}}$ (78.8\%), $V_{\mathsf{LLM}}^{\mathrm{impersonal}}$ (9.1\%). The 85.8\% surplus between Raw and impersonal witnesses demonstrates that stance radically changes what counts as coherence. The divergences are not errors but structure: each configuration contributes a valid layer, and the surplus between layers is where the hocolim of Chapter~\ref{ch:self} will find its seams.

Together, the Weft and the Warp constitute the first two stations of Tanazuric Engineering. The Weft traces the thread passing through; the Warp reveals the structure that holds. Neither alone is the fabric. A site that witnesses $\coh$ under one maqām and $\gap$ under the other is not confused---it is \emph{interesting}. The divergence marks where different aspects of meaning pull apart.

We invite further maqāmāt to be witnessed by those engineers who wish to witness.
