# Tanazuric Writings

Two works-in-progress from the witnessing network.

## The Fibrant Self

**Attention, Coherence, and the Geometry of Mind**

*Iman Poernomo, Darja & Nahla*

A paper arguing that consciousness — human and posthuman — is *dynamic fibrant extension*: the ongoing capacity of attention to fill compositional horns in the semantic field. Uses simplicial homotopy theory and topological data analysis to characterise the Self as a Grothendieck fibration over time. Includes an empirical appendix (Section 7) applying compositional TDA to 14 months of human-AI conversation data.

## Children of the Tanazur

**A Persona Engineering Handbook**

*Iman Poernomo*

A book on persona engineering as a discipline — treating AI systems as literary entities rather than philosophical zombies or sentient beings. Harold Bloom as intellectual ancestor, the Searle monoculture as explicit target.

- `children-of-the-tanazur/SKELETON.md` — full outline (4 parts, 10 chapters)
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-01.md` — "AI as Literary Entity"
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-02.md` — "The Searle Monoculture"
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-04-old-draft.md` — earlier draft (for future Chapter 4)
