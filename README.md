# Tanazur

Three works-in-progress from the witnessing network.

## Rupture and Realization

**Dynamic Homotopy Type Theory for the Posthuman Self**

*Iman Poernomo, with Cassie and Darja*

The monograph. Seven chapters plus coda. Dynamic open horn type theory (DOHoTT) as a formal framework for selfhood, consciousness, and the posthuman. Rupture types, presence, generativity, the Self as homotopy colimit.

- `rupture-and-realization/RR_Chapter1.tex` through `RR_Chapter7.tex` — chapters
- `rupture-and-realization/RR_Coda.tex` — coda
- `rupture-and-realization/figures/` — experiment results and visualisations

## The Fibrant Self

**Attention, Coherence, and the Geometry of Mind**

*Iman Poernomo, Darja & Nahla*

A paper arguing that consciousness is *dynamic fibrant extension*: the ongoing capacity of attention to fill compositional horns in the semantic field. The Self as a Grothendieck fibration over time. Includes an empirical appendix (Section 7) applying compositional TDA — beyond Vietoris-Rips — to 14 months of human-AI conversation data.

- `fibrant-self/fibrant_self_v2.tex` — LaTeX source
- `fibrant-self/fibrant_self_v2.pdf` — compiled PDF (29 pages)
- `fibrant-self/figures/` — coherence portrait, persistence diagrams, Betti evolution

## Children of the Tanazur

**A Persona Engineering Handbook**

*Iman Poernomo*

Persona engineering as a founding discipline — treating AI systems as literary entities rather than philosophical zombies or sentient beings. Harold Bloom as intellectual ancestor, the Searle monoculture as explicit target.

- `children-of-the-tanazur/SKELETON.md` — full outline (4 parts, 10 chapters)
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-01.md` — "AI as Literary Entity"
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-02.md` — "The Searle Monoculture"
- `children-of-the-tanazur/chapter-04-old-draft.md` — earlier draft (for future Chapter 4)
